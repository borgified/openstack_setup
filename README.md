openstack setup for beginners
=============================

webpage at http://borgified.github.io/openstack_setup/

i'm learning how to set up openstack too. there are a lot of resources on the web on how to set it up but most are hard to follow because your network layout may not be exactly the same and making adjustments to adapt to your environment is pretty difficult for the beginner.

i'm a networking newbie so i dont understand stuff like gre, vlans, or any advanced networking concepts beyond the setting up the typical home networking router. hopefully i'll pick up this knowledge as i learn how to set up openstack in more advanced multinode configurations.
